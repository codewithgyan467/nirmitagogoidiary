        <h1>“Pink”</h1>
        <p>By- Nirmita <br> On- 9th July, 2016 <br> @ 0300 hours, a.m. <br> Place- Delhi, India</p>
        <p>Sitting by the balcony of my little shelter, drop by drop memories pouring through my nerves saying “I want you now”. Every drop contradicting with what you kept on denying all this while…….</p>
        <p>Your eyes have deceived you, as they failed to hide the truth from me. Your smile’s too on my side confessing “Yes, I too was longing for you.” That look of your's expressing “I want to keep you in my eyes forever”....... </p>
        <p>You can't deny that you don't want me. I have just gestured all of you…… You love me which I know, you just don't want to admit it though….. No doubt that true love can be felt only in silence and in serenity. It's unspoken language can be understood by only those who are in love……</p>
        <p>So don't stop….let it grow, let it take it's time. Let it find us……..</p>
        <p>Love…..<br>Nirmita…..</p>
